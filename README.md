# Jokes Clustering Project

This project aims to cluster jokes into different categories using unsupervised learning techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed the following tasks:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Clustering using KMeans Algorithm
- Visualization using Network Graph and Parallel Coordinates

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found in the `dataset.csv`. It contains a list of jokes along with their respective clusters, thanks to https://www.kaggle.com/aryashah2k for building this dataset.

## Requirements

The project was implemented using Python 3.9.


## How to Use

To run the project, simply run the `your-dad-joked-once.ipynb` file in the root directory. This will preprocess the data, perform clustering and topic modeling, and generate visualizations.

or simply click on this link and give the notebook a run: https://www.kaggle.com/code/nihirshah/your-dad-joked-once upvote if you believe in god and upvote if you don't.

## Results

The KMeans algorithm was able to cluster the jokes into 5 different clusters of different atributes and features.

- Explore other clustering algorithms and compare their performance
- Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Expand the dataset to include more jokes and categories
